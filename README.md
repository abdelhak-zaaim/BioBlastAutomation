# bioBlastAutomation :rocket:

`bioBlastAutomation` is a Python-based project designed to automate the process of performing BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) operations. BLAST is a bioinformatics algorithm used to compare primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and/or RNA sequences.

This project utilizes the Biopython library, a set of tools for biological computation, and Flask, a web framework for Python. It also employs Plotly for data visualization.

The `bioBlastAutomation` project includes utilities for validating and identifying the type of sequences (DNA, RNA, Protein) and for checking the compatibility of the sequence with the BLAST program. It also includes functionality for saving BLAST results in different formats (XML, JSON, CSV).

A unique feature of this project is its web interface, which displays a bar chart of sequence alignments. These alignments are read from a file and visualized using Plotly.

The project is managed with pip and has dependencies on several libraries, as listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
